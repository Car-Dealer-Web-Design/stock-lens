# Stock Lens

Stock Lens turns a small manually maintained vehicle list into a readable website stock page. It includes responsive cards, optional filters and clear status labels, without a dealer-management connection.

Stock information is only as current as the supplied file. This is a presentation tool, not a live inventory or finance system. Maintained by [Car Dealer Web Design](https://cardealerwebdesign.uk/), operated by JW Digital Services Ltd.

## Start locally

Requires Node.js 22 or later. No runtime dependencies or account required.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4173/ for the complete local demonstration. Browser examples do not upload or persist entered data. The optional development server binds to loopback only.

## Input and output

Supply dealer, updatedOn, currency (GBP) and vehicles: stock_id, make, model, year, mileage, mileage_unit (mi/km), price (decimal string or blank), status (available/reserved/sold/unknown), viewing_url (optional safe HTTPS). No live stock feed or finance calculation.

Use [examples/input.json](examples/input.json) as the complete input contract. Compare the generated [JSON result](examples/output.json), [Markdown report](examples/output.md) and [complete HTML](examples/output.html). The demo is in [demo/index.html](demo/index.html). It needs the local server for JavaScript modules. HTML reports can be opened as standalone files.

```sh
node cli.mjs examples/input.json --format json
node cli.mjs examples/input.json --format html --output report.html
node cli.mjs examples/input.json --format md --output report.md
```

Flat collections can also be imported with `--csv data.csv --context context.json --key items` (replace `items` with the documented collection). Nested structures use JSON. See `node cli.mjs --help`.

## Worked example

Use six fictional stock records covering available, reserved and sold vehicles, a missing price, a long model name and a missing photograph. Do not include real registration numbers, VINs or real dealer listings. A sold card must not have an available-vehicle action; a missing price should say it needs confirmation rather than showing zero.

All supplied example records are synthetic. No clients, outcomes, current professional advice or real service availability are represented by them. Keep real records private and review output before sharing it.

## Checks

- Duplicate stock IDs fail visibly. Missing prices and zero prices are distinct, and numeric sorting is correct.
- Sold and reserved records display their real supplied state, including in filtered results and any generated detail view.
- Mileage units remain explicit. No conversion or finance claim is inferred from incomplete data.
- Image dimensions prevent layout shifts; long names fit at 320 px. All inventory remains accessible without JavaScript.
- Rendering escapes imported text and rejects unsafe action/image URLs. Screenshots contain only licensed or original assets.

The automated results and browser checks performed for this release are recorded in [verification.md](docs/verification.md). Manual screen-reader testing has not been performed. A passing automated check is not accessibility certification.

## Contribute and maintain

Use [Issues](https://github.com/Car-Dealer-Web-Design/stock-lens/issues) for a reproducible bug and [Discussions](https://github.com/Car-Dealer-Web-Design/stock-lens/discussions) for questions and improvements. Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); report vulnerabilities privately using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for releases. Maintenance is best effort.

## CSV example

```sh
node cli.mjs --csv examples/input.csv --context examples/context.json --key vehicles --format html --output csv-report.html
```

The context holds the root settings; the CSV holds the flat collection. Explicit booleans use `true` or `false`. Nested data uses JSON.
